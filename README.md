# SJSlider
*SJSlider is a simple JavaScript Content Slider used by me in some past projects .
I decided to make it public in hope that anyone will need some kind of script like this, easy to use, not complicated and ready-to-go when included !*

# What you can slide ?
*You can slide almost everything !
From text, images, to **YouTube** videos !
Is lightweight and very easy to use.
You can fully understand how it works from the example file!*
# Prerequisites

-   **JQuery** - working on almost all versions

# Configuration
*You can edit the configuration in the main **javascript** file !*
-   *current_Class* - the class of the current slide( the visible one ).
-   *left_Selector and right_Selector* - the selector for the arrows( next-prev slide )
-   *fadeIn_Time and fadeOut_Time* - times for the fadeIn / fadeOut effects
-   *timer_Interval* - just edit the left part of the addition - the interval for automatically slide

Don't want to automatically slide ? Just set **Automated** to 0 in the main **javascript** file !
# Usage

*Include the main **javascript** file of SJSlider at the bottom of the **body** element.
You are ready to go !
Just add the class **"slide" ( or what you typed in the configuration )** and everything is perfect !*
